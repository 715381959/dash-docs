- We don't have a Docs home page yet, so I changed Docs / Dash to just the Dash logo
- Need a fallback for Dash Enterprise
- I prefer a shorter header
- Body fonts seem too small
- 12px seems too small
- Flexbox prefixes?
- Box shadow on input not working?
- Replace lightgrey with #d8d8d8, or w/e our border color is
- What is our link hover color & style?
